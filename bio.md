# $ whoami?

I'm Sam Thacker, a Senior Software Engineer based in Richmond, VA. I currently work for CarMax, in addition to running my own web engineering business catering to individuals and small businesses. You can see my portfolio by typing 'portfolio' in the terminal.

Outside the realm of Software Engineering, I'm particularly interested in Philosophy of Mind and tying it to Computer Science.

If all that isn't nerdy enough for you, I also enjoy running 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons campaigns that captivate, intrigue, and challenge my players! In my opinion, TTRPGs are dynamic and collaborative storytelling at its finest.

Feel free to drop me a line at 'code [AT] codedeep [DOT] ly' -- or just type 'email'.
